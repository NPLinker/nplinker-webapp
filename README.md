# NPLinker Web Application

This is the [NPLinker](https://nplinker.github.io/nplinker/latest/) web application, developed with [Plotly Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/), which enables you to visualize NPLinker predictions in an interactive way.

NPLinker is a Python framework for data mining microbial natural products by integrating genomics and metabolomics data.

For a deep understanding of NPLinker, please refer to the [original paper](paper_link_here).

## Workshop Installation Guide

Follow these steps to set up the NPLinker dashboard on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

- [Python 3.10 or higher](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Setup Instructions
   
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/NPLinker/nplinker-webapp.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd nplinker-webapp

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

## For Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
## For macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install the required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Dashboard

After installation, start the application:

```bash
# Make sure you're in the nplinker-webapp directory
python app/main.py
```

Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8050/`.

## Input Data

The dashboard accepts data generated by NPLinker and saved as described in the [NPLinker quickstart section](https://nplinker.github.io/nplinker/latest/quickstart/). For testing purposes, a small sample dataset is provided in `tests/data/mock_obj_data.pkl` that can be used to try out the webapp.

Please note that links between genomic and metabolomic data must currently be computed using the NPLinker API separately, as this functionality is not yet implemented in the webapp (see [issue #19](https://github.com/NPLinker/nplinker-webapp/issues/19)). If no links are present in your data, the scoring table will be disabled.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

- **Port already in use**: If port 8050 is already in use, modify the port in `app/main.py` by changing `app.run_server(debug=True, port=8050)`
- **Package installation errors**: Make sure you're using a compatible Python version and that your pip is up-to-date

If you encounter other problems, please check the [Issues](https://github.com/NPLinker/nplinker-webapp/issues) page or create a new issue.

## Docker Support (Coming Soon)

A Docker container version will be available soon. Stay tuned for updates.
